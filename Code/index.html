    <h2>White Blood Cell Classification Using CNN</h2>
    <p>
      Establishing an accurate count and classification of leukocytes commonly known as WBC (white blood cells) is crucial in the assessment and detection of illness of an individual, which involves complications on the immune system that leads to various types of diseases including infections, anemia, leukemia, cancer, AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) etc. The two widely used methods to count WBC is with the use of hematology analyzer and manual counting. Currently, in the age of modernization there has been numerous research in the field of image processing incorporated with various segmentation and classification techniques to be able to generate alternatives for WBC classification and counting. However, the accuracy of these existing methods could still be improved. Thus, in this paper we proposed a new method that could segment various types of WBCs: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils from a microscopic blood image using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) saturation component with blob analysis for segmentation and incorporate CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for counting which in turn generates more accurate results.

    <h2>Prediction of Disease</h2>
    <p>
      Different regions exhibit unique characteristics of certain regional diseases, which may weaken the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm.
